# 5-Session Webinar in Coding Good Practices
**Reproducible Computational Research Skills for ICR Researchers**

---

## **Course Overview**

A practical 5-day course teaching essential coding practices for reproducible research, based on The Turing Way framework. Designed for researchers at all technical levels who use computational methods in their work.

---

## **Who might be interested?**

- **PhD students and postdocs** working with data analysis
- **Principal investigators** managing computational research projects  
- **Research staff** collaborating across computational and clinical teams
- **Anyone** writing code for research who wants to improve their practices

**No prior programming experience required** – the course accommodates mixed technical backgrounds.

---

## **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Log in to Alma** for high-performance computing
- **Create standardized project structures** for reproducible workflows
- **Use version control (Git) effectively** for collaboration and change tracking
- **GitLab and GitHub repositories** understand how to access the ICR's own instances
- **Python code in VSCode** a simple workflow with testing
- **R in RStudio** a simple workflow with testing
- **Manage computational environments** using conda and Docker for long-term reproducibility
- **Apply The Turing Way principles** for transparent, collaborative, and sustainable research
